Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?
Yes, I have Shakespeare's works in hand. I may want to find other literature to test my models on.

Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?
No. I have created many features for the purpose of this, but have not yet graphed or analyzed them.

Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?
No. I am working extensively on the data engineering process to create a good model.

What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?
Not really, just time.

Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?
No.

What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you have to get done versus what would you like to get done?
Remove stopwords from the corpus, implement NER, create columns for WordNet hypernyms, find another play (possibly Les Miserables) to test on.

What topics do you want to discuss during your 1:1?
NER, other NLP processes I may not know.
