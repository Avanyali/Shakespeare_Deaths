This project represents the creation of a model that can take in all of the dialogue that any character from any (English) work of writing speaks and determine whether that character will live or die in their respective literature.

The model has been created by modernizing the language used in 38 of Shakespeare's plays using a combination of lemmatizing, POS tagging, hypernymomizing, and synonymizing. A simple working widget can be run with streamlit and is in "notebooks/ShakespeareWidget.py". Character lines should be separated by newlines for best performance.
